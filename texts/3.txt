In a relational database, a database is composed of one or more tables. A
table is the principal unit of storage in a database. Each table in a database is
generally modeled after some type of real-world entity, such as a customer or
a product (though as we will see, some tables do not correspond to real-world
entities but are used to relate entities together). A table is a two-dimensional
container for data that consists of records (rows); each record has the same
number of columns, which are more specifically called fields, which contain
the actual data. Each table will have one (or sometimes more than one)
special field called a primary key that is used to uniquely identify each record
in a table. Figure 14.3 illustrates these different terms.
