Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in genome function that are not associated with DNA sequence alterations. Such changes occur in all kingdoms of life. In bacteria, DNA methylation plays a role in the formation of cell lineages. In eukaryotes, multiple mechanisms of chromatin modification permit mitotic and/or meiotic transmission of epigenetic states. Inheritance of epigenetic marks is crucial for the establishment of cell fates during the development of multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic epigenetic states are reprogrammed during gametogenesis and early embryonic development. Abnormal epigenetic states can predispose to or cause human diseases.
