There are actually two types of inline elements: replaced and nonreplaced.
Replaced inline elements are elements whose content and thus appearance are
defined by some external resource, such as <img> and the various form
elements. Nonreplaced inline elements are those elements whose content is
defined within the document, and includes all the other inline elements.
Replaced inline elements have a width and height that are defined by the
external resource and thus have the regular CSS box model discussed in
Chapter 4. Nonreplaced inline elements, in contrast, have a constrained box
model. For instance, because their width is defined by their content (and by
other properties such as font-size and letter-spacing), the width property
is ignored, as are the margin-top, margin-bottom, and the height.
